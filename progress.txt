1(linear1). Tried linear regression with 4 classes (4 actions) with penalty = -negative distance from x = 5. None good
2. Tried linear regression with 4 classes (4 actions) with penalty = -negative distance from x = 5 and -1 for each action. No good plots, but the reward seems good (many -1) in the reward.txt file. 
3(linear3). Tried linear regression with 4 classes (4 actions) with penalty = -negative distance from x = 5, and the episode ends with the line reaches x=5. Very noisy avg reward plot for lr 0.05, 0.01. For 0.005 it is still noisy but over a much smaller range. Mostly bad.
4(linear4). Tried linear regression with 2 classes (2 actions, e, w) with penalty = -negative distance from x = 5 and -1 for each action. None good, no idea why. Very noise award function. 
5(linear5). Tried linear regression with 2 classes (2 actions, e, w) with penalty = -negative distance from x = 5 and -1 for each action, and reduce space y - 0 to 1. I got some good success with lr 0.05, episode 500, 1000 and max time 1000, 2000 - overall 4 good plots. Gamma was 0.99 specific only. The reward plots are also very stable for these 4 plots. 
The plots for gamma = 1.0, are very unstable, so bad performance is logical. Conclusion is aim for high episodes and high max_time (try 4000, 5000 maxtime also.)
6(linear6). Tried linear regression with 2 classes (2 actions, e, w) with penalty = -negative distance from x = 5 and -1 for each action, and reduce space y - 0 to 1. This was based on exp5 where I learned higher episodes, max_time and lr in 0.01, 0.05 was favorable. I tried all the 3 gamma values. One thing I want to ask is the difference that is being created in gamma 0.99 and 0.999, specifically: avg_reward_0.05_0.99_2000_1000.png, avg_reward_0.05_0.999_2000_1000.png.
