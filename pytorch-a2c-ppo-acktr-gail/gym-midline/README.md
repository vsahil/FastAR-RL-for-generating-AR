# Description of Environment

This is a very simple environment. The space is from 4.0 to 6.0 in X-axis and 0.0 to 1.0 in the Y-axis. An agent is initialized anywhere in this space and the goal is to reach the midline (X = 5) and stay there forever. Each action will move the agent by a small amount (0.05 in each direction parallel to the X-axis), but the agent should learn to reach the midline and remain close thereafter. Refer the the `reach_mid_line.py` file for reward function.
